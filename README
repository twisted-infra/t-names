This is the configuration for twistedmatrix.com's DNS server using twisted.names.

It is adminstered using braid[1]. It is installed in `/srv/t-names` as user t-names.
It uses the following directories

~/config - This repository.
~/config/zones - DNS zone info
~/bin - commands to start and stop the server
~/log - log files
~/run - pid files

The DNS info has the ip address of all hosts in `hosts.py`, as well as some utility
functions. The remaning files are zone definitions using those utilities and hosts.

The following fabric commands are available:

install - Create user and install configuration.
update - Updates the configuration and restarts the server.
start - Start server.
stop - Stop server.
